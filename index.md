## Life Expectancy Causal Analysis Project

In this project, we aim to establish causality between various socioeconomic variables and life expectancy outcomes in  roughly 166 different countries, noting the strongest connections between economic and political factors with the length of life expectancy. 

Below you will find background information on our data, our reasoning, our methods, and how to gather information for real world questions you can have.
